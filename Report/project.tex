\section{Introduction}

There is a strong push today to develop more environmentally-friendly ways of generating and using energy. One of the most available and interesting sources of alternative energy is solar energy. While solar energy is abundant, it tends to be of a lower grade than other forms. As such, the harvesting of this energy should be done as efficiently as possible in order to maximize the output which is needed for various applications.

This analysis compares the efficiencies of two designs for a solar water heater: one with a convection shield, and one without. The objective is to determine whether one design has a significant advantage over the other in terms of energy efficiency. The analysis is carried out using fundamental laws and principles of thermodynamics and heat transfer in order to develop a model of the solar water heater under both shielded and unshielded conditions. This model is then used to predict values for the efficiencies of the designs and give recommendations based on the results.
